Power on is can be done with a simple jumper, or an external switch can be used if perfered, for example via a screw switch. The GPS coordinates of the SimpleTracker are transmitted via 433MHz LoRa every second providing several km of tracking range depending on the antenna used on the SimpleTracker and the ground station. SimpleTracker can also be used as a minimal ground station, reporting the location of a paired tracker via USB serial connection to a PC or phone.
